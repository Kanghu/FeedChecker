# FeedChecker
 A simple web application that reads out an users Instagram feed.

The following account is a sandbox user for the application:  
Username: artstudio_test  
Password: arstudio100  

The redirect from the authentication page back to our application is  
https://localhost:44375/Instagram/Access

Thus the server should be hosted on localhost:44375 in order to correctly
redirect back.
